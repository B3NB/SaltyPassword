# SaltyPassword ðŸ¤”ðŸ’­
Nothing is as bad at remembering things, especially passwords, as humans, well at least this applies to my memory. That's why I made this command line program in C# to help remember long, new passwords.

Secure passwords are really important, so the way we choose them becomes equally as important. The best way I found to make new passwords, is using the method described [here](https://www.eff.org/dice) by the EFF. Though sometimes this results in me mixing up the words in my brain and I sometimes need check if I remember everything correctly.
